MOBILE CHARTER FOR NURSES IN CANADA
-----------------------------------








Notes made: 
> Nurse Connects to device on the webpage
> In the UserDashboard page, Nurse should be able to click on the Device widget and register both name and Charter ID.
> Nurse should be able to Override Charter ID.

> I brought up the issue that it might be necessary to add Session Ids each time a Nurse Logs in to the user-dashboard page,
in such a way that they might be able to continue activities when switching browsers or chrome tabs, this provides fluidity to
the application and webpage. Coupled with this is the idea that when a Nurse is logged in on multiple browsers, logging out on
one would be logging out on all automatically when the pages are refreshed. Israel then brought up the concern that this would
interfere with admins or IT operators who for some reason may want to have access to the pages of specific nurses, they wouldn't
be able to effectively do this if Nurses log out of their pages constantly.

**Idea**
> Make database centralized and accessible to all in such a way that changes made to the database doesn't affect only me but also
affects everyone who has access to it.
---------------------------
Where this would be useful?
---------------------------
Consider a case where we get our device working and transmission of text to the webpage is done, Regardless of location or system,
One should be able to log in to the room in which the real-time transmission is done and be able to see the live update of
transmission.
I'm guessing this would likely mean: Device ---> Database ---> Webpage.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Room Unassigned decision in uploads of the Staff. Is it necessary, is it not?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is Room Unassigned? This happens when a room is not properly recorded and or does not exist and so audio data can the not be
assigned to any room and so what happens is these audio files are saved in a folder of their own under the uploads of the Staff
Dashboard.

Why it is necessary?
> To preserve data. Even if a room isn't properly recorded, data in any case should not be discarded. And so it would make sense
to still keep it under uploads.

How would it be implemented?
> Under the "Uploads" section in the Staff dashboard page there would be an "Unassigned" tab containing audio data in which the room
data was not properly recorded. The Nurse would have the option to re-listen to the room audio recording and main audio recording, be
able to infer the likely room the charting was meant for, and be able to transfer the data to the room.

Problem with this?
It's too rough to execute and doesn't flow well when thinking about the user experience.

Proferred solution to this problem?
Scrap the whole idea of "Unassigned" tab, simply alert the Nurse when a room hasn't been properly recorded by the device, this could be
done by both blinking of a red light, beeping, or both.


> Note: we've recently made a decision to change our tech stack to a more modern one: NextJS, and are currently in the process of converting
what we have so far to a NextJS project.
