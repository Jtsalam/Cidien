This file is for documentation purposes of our plans, Ideas and updates in developing this product.

Tags and their meanings:
[Note]: Important information on development plan
[sidenote]: Update on a [Note]; always preceeding a [Note] / [Idea]
[Idea]: Possible addition to the product
[error]: A repeatedly encountered issue in development
-----------------------------------------------------



[sidenote]: We've decided on going fully software with this product as we feel it would make scaling a lot easier. For now,
each nurse goes on the webpage on their phone, selects their organization and logs in with their staff Id. through this we 
would be able to keep track of each nurse and the room assigned to them.
[Note]:
> Nurse Connects to device on the webpage
> In the UserDashboard page, Nurse should be able to click on the Device widget and register both name and Charter ID.
> Nurse should be able to Override Charter ID.

> I brought up the issue that it might be necessary to add Session Ids each time a Nurse Logs in to the user-dashboard page,
in such a way that they might be able to continue activities when switching browsers or chrome tabs, this provides fluidity to
the application and webpage. Coupled with this is the idea that when a Nurse is logged in on multiple browsers, logging out on
one would be logging out on all automatically when the pages are refreshed. Israel then brought up the concern that this would
interfere with admins or IT operators who for some reason may want to have access to the pages of specific nurses, they wouldn't
be able to effectively do this if Nurses log out of their pages constantly.



[sidenote]: We are currently deciding to keep in non-centralized for now. As we scale, we will consider using a neon database.
[Idea]:
> Make database centralized and accessible to all in such a way that changes made to the database doesn't affect only me but also
affects everyone who has access to it.
---------------------------
Where this would be useful?
---------------------------
Consider a case where we get our device working and transmission of text to the webpage is done, Regardless of location or system,
One should be able to log in to the room in which the real-time transmission is done and be able to see the live update of
transmission.
I'm guessing this would likely mean: Device ---> Database ---> Webpage.

[Note]:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Room Unassigned decision in uploads of the Staff. Is it necessary, is it not?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is Room Unassigned? This happens when a room is not properly recorded and or does not exist and so audio data can the not be
assigned to any room and so what happens is these audio files are saved in a folder of their own under the uploads of the Staff
Dashboard.

Why it is necessary?
> To preserve data. Even if a room isn't properly recorded, data in any case should not be discarded. And so it would make sense
to still keep it under uploads.

How would it be implemented?
> Under the "Uploads" section in the Staff dashboard page there would be an "Unassigned" tab containing audio data in which the room
data was not properly recorded. The Nurse would have the option to re-listen to the room audio recording and main audio recording, be
able to infer the likely room the charting was meant for, and be able to transfer the data to the room.

Problem with this?
It's too rough to execute and doesn't flow well when thinking about the user experience.

Proferred solution to this problem?
Scrap the whole idea of "Unassigned" tab, simply alert the Nurse when a room hasn't been properly recorded by the device, this could be
done by both blinking of a red light, beeping, or both.

[Note]:
we've recently made a decision to change our tech stack to a more modern one: NextJS, and are currently in the process of converting
what we have so far to a NextJS project.

[sidenote]: I have decided to halt Account registration process
[Note]:
REGISTER ACCOUNT LOGIC **(DRAFT 2)-> ##NOTE: I HAVE MADE CHANGES TO THIS LOGIC AND PUT THEM IN PICTURE FORMAT(FIND IN "DocFiles" folder)
> Make google form requesting for:
    Name of organization
    Email of organization
    Contact of organization
    Address of organization
    Number of Staffs in the organization(rounded to 100)
    Logo of Organization
> After form is filled. Inform registrer that information has been received and email will be sent soon.
> Do process of vetting(researching) and send email to organization or give a call.:
We've settled on sending a confirmation email where the recipient has to send two things: a confirmation 
text as well as a scanned government Id or an organization Id (sample excerpt stated below).
> After this is sent, we go on the "organization status" page and click accept on the organization to send 
the info to the database.
: Then this process can also automatically send an email with the calendly link to set up a zoom meeting with the organization.

> In the zoom meeting we talk about what the device is about, how to make use of the device, explain the role of an IT personell
and set up an IT Id and password that can be registered on the system.
> The following pages needed for the latter stages of this process would be done later
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


[Note]:
> Transformer model; for medical jargon. Needs to be tightened for accuracy 
> Edit for texts and version history.
> Login to charting device with staff ID -> Keep track of Nurse
