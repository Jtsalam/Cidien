MOBILE CHARTER FOR NURSES IN CANADA









Notes made: 
> Nurse Connects to device on the webpage
> In the UserDashboard page, Nurse should be able to click on the Device widget and register both name and Charter ID.
> Nurse should be able to Override Charter ID.

> I brought up the issue that it might be necessary to add Session Ids each time a Nurse Logs in to the user-dashboard page, in such a way that they might be able to continue activities when switching browsers or chrome tabs, this provides fluidity to the application and webpage. Coupled with this is the idea that when a Nurse is logged in on multiple browsers, logging out on one would be logging out on all automatically when the pages are refreshed. Israel then brought up the concern that this would interfere with admins or IT operators who for some reason may want to have access to the pages of specific nurses, they wouldn't be able to effectively do this if Nurses log out of their pages constantly.

**Idea**
> Make database centralized and accessible to all in such a way that changes made to the database doesn't affect only me but also affects everyone who has access to it. Where this would be useful?
Consider a case where we get our device working and transmission of text to the webpage is done, Regardless of location or system, One should be able to log in to the room in which the real-time transmission is done and be able to see the live update of transmission:
I'm guessing this would likely mean: Device ---> Database ---> Webpage.
