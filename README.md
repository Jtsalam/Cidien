TO GET STARTED
--------------
Step 1:
Go to Branch experiment/NextJS on github, then create a branch in your name in this format: "{Name}sBranch" e.g tobisBranch. Then clone on your system.

Step 2:
Ask me for the database .env variable, create and paste it in a file called .env

Step 3:
Run:
npx prisma generate
then npx run dev

Step 4:
View "Issues" tab on repository to see assigned tasks.

And Lastly:
ASK QUESTIONS WHEN STUCK!!; can't stress the value of this enough, it helps us grow as developers and also makes us complete tasks as fast as possible.


Happy coding! 🚀
