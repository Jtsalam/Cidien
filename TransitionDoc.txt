QUICK START CONTEXT FOR NEW CONVERSATIONS
If you're starting a new conversation about this project, this document contains everything you need to know about the system, its architecture, features, known issues, and solutions.

================================================================================
1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
================================================================================

Mobile Charter is a comprehensive medical center management system focused on audio transcription workflow for healthcare staff. The system manages audio recordings from patient rooms, provides real-time transcription capabilities, and implements an approval workflow for clinical notes.

Key Purpose:
- Staff (nurses, doctors) receive live audio transcriptions from patient rooms
- They can review, edit, and approve these transcriptions
- Approved notes move to an archived section for record keeping
- Real-time updates ensure immediate notification of new transcriptions

Target Users:
- Medical center staff (nurses, doctors)
- Administrators managing room assignments and bed allocation
- Multiple medical centers: JPCH, EHC, EMC, KMC, PVM

================================================================================

- Room assignment and bed allocation features

================================================================================
4. CRITICAL BUG FIXES & SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED
================================================================================

4.1 MAJOR FIX: Transcription Approval API Route Mismatch (SOLVED)
Problem: HTTP 404 error on approve button - "PATCH /api/staff/transcriptions/7/1000/approve 404"

Root Cause:
- API route expected: /api/staff/transcriptions/[id]/approve (single combined ID)
- Frontend was calling: /api/staff/transcriptions/7/1000/approve (separate patient_id/session_id)

Solution Applied:
- Fixed DataTable.tsx handleApprove function
- Changed from: `/api/staff/transcriptions/${patientId}/${sessionId}/approve`
- To: `/api/staff/transcriptions/${rowId}/approve`
- Where rowId = `${patient_id}_${session_id}`

File: /components/DataTable.tsx:448

4.2 Database Integration Fixes
- Fixed patient_id and session_id composite key handling
- Resolved Prisma schema compatibility with existing data
- Added is_approved field to patient_uploads table for workflow

4.3 Socket.io Connection Management
- Implemented connection status tracking
- Added reconnection logic for dropped connections
- Visual indicators for real-time data flow

================================================================================

8. KNOWN ISSUES & FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
================================================================================

8.1 Current Challenges:
- DataTable.tsx is 700+ lines and needs refactoring
- Audio preloading could be optimized for larger datasets
- Error handling for network failures needs improvement
- Role-based permissions not fully implemented

8.2 Recommended Improvements:
- Extract smaller components from DataTable.tsx:
  * AudioPlayerButton
  * EditableCell  
  * TableStatusBar
  * ActionButtons
- Implement comprehensive error boundaries
- Add pagination for large transcription lists
- Enhanced filtering and search capabilities
- Better mobile responsiveness

8.3 Security Considerations:
- Audio files should have access controls
- Transcription approval should have audit trails
- Staff permissions need granular controls

================================================================================
9. DEVELOPMENT COMMANDS
================================================================================

Setup:
```bash
npm install
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev
npm run dev
```

Database:
```bash
npx prisma studio  # Database GUI
npx prisma migrate reset  # Reset database
```

Testing:
```bash
npm run build  # Production build test
npm run lint   # Code linting
```

================================================================================
10. SOCKET.IO EVENTS
================================================================================

Client-side events handled:
- 'new_transcription' - New audio transcription received
- 'connect' - Socket connection established  
- 'disconnect' - Socket connection lost
- 'receiving' - Data actively being received

Data format for new_transcription:
```javascript
{
  id: "new_transcription_[uuid]",
  audioUrl: "/path/to/audio.webm",
  column1: "date",
  column2: "time", 
  column3: "room_info",
  column4: "transcribed_text",
  isNew: true,
  isApproved: false
}
```

================================================================================
11. DEBUGGING TIPS
================================================================================

Common Issues:
1. 404 on approval: Check API route structure matches frontend calls
2. Socket not connecting: Verify Socket.io server is running
3. Audio not playing: Check file paths and CORS settings
4. Database errors: Run `npx prisma generate` after schema changes

Useful Console Commands:
- Check socket status: Look for connection badges in UI
- Audio cache: Check browser Network tab for preloaded files
- Database: Use Prisma Studio to inspect data directly

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

This is a production medical transcription system with real-time capabilities. The main workflow is: audio recording → live transcription → staff review/edit → approval → archived storage. The recent fix for the approval API route mismatch resolved the critical 404 error that was preventing the approval workflow from functioning.

Key files to focus on for future development:
- DataTable.tsx (main UI component)
- /api/staff/transcriptions/ routes (backend logic)
- Prisma schema (database structure)
- Socket context (real-time functionality)
